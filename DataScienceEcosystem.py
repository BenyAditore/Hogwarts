# # Data Science Tools and Ecosystem

# In this notebook, Data Science and Ecosystem are summerized. 

# **Objectives:**
# * Categories of Data Science Tools are Data Management, Data Integration and Transformation, Data Visualization, Model Builder, Model Deployment, Model Monitoring and Assessment
# * Categories supporte by Data Asset Management, Code Asset Management, Execution Enviorment and Developement Enviorment.
# * Every language has it own features and uses.
# * Machine Learning Models can devide into three basic types: Supervised learning, Unsupervised learning and Reinforcement learning.

# Some of the popular languages that Data Scientist use are:
# 1. Python
# 2. R
# 3. SQL
# 4. Java
# 5. Scala

# Some of the commonly used libraries used by Data Scientist include:
# 1. Pandas
# 2. Numpy
# 3. Seaborn
# 4. Keras
# 5. Matplotlib
